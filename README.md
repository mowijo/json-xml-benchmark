This is the sample code for a benchmark I did to compare how XML and Json performed for a specific application.  it features downloading from a webserver and encoding using three different XML decoders and two different Json decoders.
See http://www.vikingsoft.eu/blog/?p=226 for a blogpost about the experiment.
